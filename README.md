# Swap App

## Responsively tuned swap website using React and redux. Authentication, Firestore Database, Firebase Storage are used. Reduxjs/toolkit is used for redux. There are also operations such as adding products, deleting products, editing products, sending exchange offers, and purchasing. I think it's a detailed react-redux project.
